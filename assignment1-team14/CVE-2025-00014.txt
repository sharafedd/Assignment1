CVE ID: CVE-2025-00014

Description:
A stack-based buffer overflow in evilcorp_js 0.1.2.1 occurs in parse_statement() at line 148, where strcpy() copies identifiers from current text into the 64-byte stack buffer name without length checks, allowing attacker-controlled input to overflow the buffer.

Estimated severity:
Overall CVSS v3.1 Score: 7.7 (Rating: High)
CVSS v3.1 Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:U/RC:C

Estimated Impact: 
A malicious input file can trigger a crash, corrupting the interprete's internal state and causing denial of service. Because the overflow occurs near control-flow data on the stack, it also presents a theoretical path to arbitrary code execution under weaker protections.

Affected Product:
cpe:2.3:a:evilcorp:evilcorp_js:0.1.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Patch:
Replace strcpy() with a bounded copy (e.g., strncpy()), enforce identifier length validation, avoid processing untrusted files, and enable compiler protections such as stack canaries and ASLR.
